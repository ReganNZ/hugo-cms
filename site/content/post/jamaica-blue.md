We recommend placing your stand facing outwards towards the road and even slightly angled, this way cars sitting in traffic, people walking accross the road and people walking past can all see your sign. Rather than just the people walking towards the sign. This simple trick is valuable - brand awareness works!

Remember you don't know which business or consumer car passenger - travelling or walking on the other side of the road - is looking or thinking about exactly what your business has to offer at any given time - and therefore needs and wants to see your sign!\
