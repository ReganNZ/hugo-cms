  "Where do I start?" Great question, we recommend starting with brochure
  holders - if you are unsure of the next step for your display, as simple as
  this might sound - it is something your customer needs to see.

They are valuable for expos, office display, menu holder/restaurant display and can be used for promotion anywhere anytime. Once you have a promotion organised for your brochure holder you will have a better or a clear idea of what to do next. For example you may then want to move on to bigger ideas such as snap frames or show room display.\
\
Another reason to use brochure holders is because it is not invasive and can be a great focal point but not a barrier for customers at your place of business, expo or promotion. It is a non verbal conversation starter to enhance other types of display and can go out the front of a business without being overwhelming.\
Many customers appreciate this and will be more inclined to stop and talk to you and of course it gives you the opportunity of pointing out your promotion in a conversational way because holders are a friendly size and can go in useful positions.
